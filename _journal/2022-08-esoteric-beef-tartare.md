### Ingredients

* 200 Tartare Meat (good pure mashed up (minced) beef)
* 3 garlic cloves (4 if small cloves)

* 0,5 Tsp Pure Olive oil
* Salt, pepper
* Cayenne pepper (optional)

### Instructions

1. Turn the garlic into tiny pieces
2. Turn the onion into tiny pieces
3. Separate egg yolk from egg white. 
I like to use [this Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAGX-54iR30) for separating egg whites and yolks^1].
4. Put meat in bowl, add All of the ingredients. (Season by your own preference, I like to put a lot of pepper always)
5. Mash the meat and ingredients together completely with clean hands
6. Create shape (for example, a Ball :D)
7. Eat!
