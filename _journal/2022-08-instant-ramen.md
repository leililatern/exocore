> What I want to achieve with this recipe is so a girl (or boy) that doesn't know how to start with eating healthy food can buy random cheap instant ramen and then customize it fully and turn it into a nice easy healthy dish.

> so ; Cheap ramen is the base and adding things to it to makes it a full meal !

I am going to try Instant Ramen with :

- [ ] Egg! Soft-medium boil
- [ ] Spicy spices
- [ ] Salt, pepper
- [ ] Vinegar 
- [ ] Curry powder
- [ ] Spices. Sichuan pepper Cayenne pepperCinnamon stick coriander cardamom ????
- [ ] Lemon juic/slice
- [ ] Butter or animals fats as oil
- [ ] Fresh Greens. Spinach and basil
- [ ] Thinly sliced meats / pulled pork
- [ ] Le shrimp!
- [ ] Spicy sauces
- [ ] Soy sauce
- [ ] Ginger, Garlic, green onion
- [ ] Mushroom, bell pepper?
- [ ] Kimchi, sriracha sauce
- [ ] Sesame seeds
- [ ] Nori (seaweed)
- [ ] Peanut Butter
- [ ] Coconut milk
- [ ] Chicke n/beef/bacon, simmer it in the soup
- [ ] Chia seeds
- [ ] Parmesan
- [ ] Miso paste

This can all be tried with high quality noodles too. I will try it with cheapest noodles and good noodles ! Not to worry, I will experiment until I find the best recipe :DDD
